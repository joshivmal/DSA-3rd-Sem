										Recursion:
 
							When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

Main points:  1) base condition.    2) stack overflow / Stack space.    3) recursion.

BackTracking: is the recursive method in which we get the answer/output when returning to the function.

Parameterized recursion: recursions are those in which we pass the parameter and print the output.
Functional Recursion: those recursive functions that return the function and take fewer parameters.

									Video 6 -> Recursion on subsequences

Subsequence -> A contiguous/non-contiguous sequence of an array, which follows the order.  
Ex: 
                arr[] -> {3,2,1} 

		3 1 2 
		3 1 
		3 2 
		3 
		1 2 
		1 
		2 
		{} -> empty set.
